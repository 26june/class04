      <h3>Spaghetti Carbonara</h3>
      <div class="content1">
        <p>
          Carbonara is a pasta dish made with eggs, hard cheese, cured pork, and
          black pepper. The dish took its modern form and name in the middle of
          the 20th century. The cheese is usually Pecorino Romano, parmesan, or
          a combination of the two. Spaghetti is the most common pasta, but
          fettuccine, rigatoni, linguine, or bucatini are also used. Normally
          guanciale or pancetta are used for the meat component, but lardons of
          smoked bacon are a common substitute outside Italy.
